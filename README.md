# Deep-learning-models

This repository is my collection of deep learning models. The deep learning models I have made so far.
I am still updating it, although a few deep learning models are ready, right now. I have written everything in tensorflow 
wrapped in python. 

1] [Basic Neural Networks](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/Deep-learning-models/tree/master/Neural%20Networks): A few simple to make
    and easy to understand deep learning models.
   
2] [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/Deep-learning-models/tree/master/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks): A collection of
    convolutional networks applied on different datasets. Different types of convolutional neural networks will also be added.
    
3] [AutoEncoders](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/Deep-learning-models/tree/master/AutoEncoders): A bunch of autoencoders applied on
    different tasks, training methods, etc... I will be adding more soon.
