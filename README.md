# Deep Learning Basics
This is a repository on all the deep learning models I've tried to implement by myself. I will also add a preprocessing class that supports certain image preprocessing in the future. So far there are only two models but I well be adding models regularly.
* 1] [Multilayer perceptron on the MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/DeepLearningBasics/blob/master/MLP.py)
* 2] [Convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/DeepLearningBasics/blob/master/ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.py)
