# Deep learning models
This is a repository on all the deep learning models I've tried to implement by myself. 
* 1] [Multilayer perceptron on the MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/DeepLearningBasics/blob/master/MLP.py) A simple implementation of a **multilayer perceptron model** in tensorflow that trains on the MNIST dataset.
* 2] [Convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/DeepLearningBasics/blob/master/ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.py) A implementation of a **convolutional neural network** in tensorflow that trains on the MNIST dataset.
* 3] [Autoencoder network on the MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/DeepLearningBasics/blob/master/Autoencoder.py) A simple implementation of an **Autoencoder network** in tensorflow that trains on the MNIST dataset.
* 4] [ProbAutoEncoder on the MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/DeepLearningBasics/blob/master/QuickAutoencoder.py) **An autoencoder network** I have made it can generate completely new data simply by passing a probability vector through it. It trains really quickly too.
* 5] [CombinedRNN on the MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/Deep-learning-models/blob/master/CombinedRNN.py) I have been working on RNNs recently and I have tried to make my own type of RNN called a combinedRNN. It still is not as efficient as I thought it would be. However by changing the dataset to a stock prediction dataset and tweaking a few tensor operation and revising the graph. It will be ready and hopefully as effecient as I intended it to. 

I will also add a preprocessing class that supports certain image preprocessing in the future. To use images other that the MNIST dataset. So far there are only two models but I well be adding models regularly.
