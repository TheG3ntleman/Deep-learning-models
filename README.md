# Deep Learning Basics
This is a repository on all the deep learning models I've tried to implement by myself. 
* 1] [Multilayer perceptron on the MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/DeepLearningBasics/blob/master/MLP.py) A simple implementation of a multilayer perceptron model in tensorflow that trains on the MNIST dataset.
* 2] [Convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/TheG3ntleman/DeepLearningBasics/blob/master/ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.py) A implementation of a convolutional neural network in tensorflow that trains on the MNIST dataset.
* 3] [Autoencoder network on the MNIST dataset:]Autoencoder convolutional neural network in tensorflow that trains on the MNIST dataset.

I will also add a preprocessing class that supports certain image preprocessing in the future. To use images other that the MNIST dataset. So far there are only two models but I well be adding models regularly.
